Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following
execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # docker_container.nginx_container will be created

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform
apply" now.
